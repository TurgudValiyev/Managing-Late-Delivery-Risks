### Managing Late Delivery Risks

##### Project Overview
This project focuses on improving delivery performance and enhancing customer satisfaction by predicting and managing late delivery risks in supply chains. The analysis leverages historical order, customer, and product data to identify factors contributing to delivery delays and proposes actionable insights for minimizing these risks.

##### Objective
The main goal of this project is to predict late delivery risks using data-driven techniques, allowing businesses to take proactive steps in managing delays and improving overall delivery performance. By predicting which orders are at risk of being delayed, companies can optimize resources, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve supply chain efficiency.

##### Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features such as:

Customer Information: City, country, segment, etc.

Order Details: Order status, delivery times, shipping methods, etc.

Product Information: Category, price, quantity, etc.

Delivery Risk: Target variable indicating the risk of late delivery.

##### Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The initial step involved analyzing the dataset to understand patterns, identify trends, and clean the data for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Key features influencing delivery performance were extracted and transformed to improve model accuracy.

Machine Learning Models: Various machine learning models were applied to predict late delivery risks. These included decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression.

Evaluation: Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics to assess their ability to predict delivery delays.

##### Results
The project achieved a model with satisfactory accuracy in predicting late delivery risks. Insights gained from the analysis suggest key factors contributing to delayed deliveries and offer strategies for mitigating these risks.

##### Tools and Technologies
Python: For data analysis and machine learning modeling.

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms.

Git & GitHub: Version control and collaboration.

##### Future Work
Implement real-time prediction systems for late delivery risks.

Explore advanced deep learning models for improved accuracy.

Incorporate additional data sources, such as weather or traffic data, for better predictions.
